Midterm Exam 2019- Seth Jones
Basics
Which file type is mainly used in Python programs?
1- .jpg
2- .json
3- .py
4- .png
3
The .py type is the main file type used in Python.
Basics
Which of these variables is an example of camel case?
1- Camel Case
2- CamelCase
3- camel_case
4- camelCase
4
Camel case is excluding spaces but capitalizing all words besides the first.
Syntax
How would you fix this piece of code?/print(This needs to be fixed.)
1- ("This needs to be fixed.")
2- print"(This needs to be fixed.)"
3- print: "This needs to be fixed."
4- print("This needs to be fixed.")
4
Print statements, when printing a string, must use quotation marks inside of/ the print function.
Lists and Tuples
How would you print the third item of the list 'container'?
1- print(container[3])
2- print(container[2])
3- print(container(3))
4- print(container(2))
2
Making sure to account for 0 being the first item and brackets calling the/ 'container' item, print(container[2]) will print the third item.
Imports
Which line of code below will import the function 'sleep' correctly?
1- from time import sleep
2- import sleep
3- import datetime
4- from delay import sleep
1
'from time import sleep' will correctly import the sleep function.
Lists and Tuples
How would you create a tuple with the name 'container'?
1- container = ("bop", 1, 8.0)
2- container = ["bop", 1, 8.0]
3- container = "bop", 1, 8.0
4- container = {"bop", 1, 8.0}
1
Using parenthesis will give you a tuple, whereas brackets will give you a list.
Functions
Which one of these functions will give you a random number inside the range /0 and 10 for a float?
1- random.random(0,10)
2- random.float(0,10)
3- random.pop(0,10)
4- random.uniform(0,10)
4
random.uniform(0,10) will give you a random float between 0 and 10, whereas/ random.random(0,10) will only generate a random float between 0 and 1.
Functions
What will math.fabs() do?
1- round a float to the nearest integer
2- return the absolute value of a number
3- add all numbers in a list together
4- return the square root of a number
2
'math.fabs' returns the absolute value of any integer or float.
Imports
What happens when another .py file is imported? For example:/ import midterm.py
1- Nothing, the file must be called for it to run
2- The file will run immediately
3- The file will run after any other code in the initial program
4- Whether it will run depends on the contents of the file
2
Wherever you import the .py file, it will run.
Loops
When will a 'while True' loop stop?
1- It won't
2- It will stop when the conditions of the loop aren't met
3- It will stop when 'break' is called
4- It will stop when 'continue' is called
3
A 'while True' loop will only stop when 'break' is called, because/ the condition 'while True' is always true.
Syntax
Which results will this code return?/print(str.format("Let's get this {}",bread))
1- Let's get this bread
2- 'Let's get this bread'
3- SyntaxError
4- NameError
4
NameError: name 'bread' is not defined
Syntax
Which one of these isn't a key word in Python?
1- then
2- for
3- while
4- as
1
You should probably know this. 'Then' isn't a keyword.
Loops
What does 'i' stand for in Python?
1- integer
2- increase
3- increment
4- item
3
'i' stands for increment. It goes along through each item in a list/ or tuple by increments.
Basics
What does 'def' do in a Python program?
1- it defines a function and runs it
2- it defines a function
3- it creates a variable
4- it doesn't do anything
2
The 'def' keyword defines a function.
Lists and Tuples
What does '.append' do for a list?
1- removes an item from the list
2- removes every item from the list
3- adds an item to the list
4- duplicates an item in the list
3
'.append' will add an item of your choosing to the list.
Loops
What will 'return' do?
1- same as break
2- take files from whatever function it is in
3- restart the file
4- go
2
This is easy, come on. It will return files from a function.
Imports
What does datetime do?
1- kill you
2- help with time and date variables
3- help with math variables
4- help with weather variables
2
'datetime' helps with time and date formatting.

1- A New Hope
2- Revenge of the Sith
