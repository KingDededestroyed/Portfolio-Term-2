>Basic Functions
How do you do a Print Statement?
print()
print("")
input()
I don't know
2 
print("") have to have the quotations.
>Functions
Writing an "if" statement, what should be placed between the "if" keyword and the final colon (:)?
syntax
mathmatical expression 
varible name
logical expression
4  
You have to place a colon otherwise it runs on forever
>Functions
What debugger command will show you lines of code around the line that will be executed? 
print(p)
display(d)
list(l)
status(s)
3 
list will show you the lines of code.
>Functions
Why would you use random.seed()?
To begin generating the same sequence of "random" numbers from a particular seed value  
To enable the random library to provide any random numbers at all
To set the minimum and maximum values produced by the random functions 
To ensure random numbers will start out small and then grow over time
1 is the right anwser
it will randomize the sequence.
>operators
Which of the following is not a comparison operator?
None of these are comparison operators
Or
And
+
1
comparison operators are these >,<,=.
>Commands
Which of the following is not a python debugger command?
Continue(c)
Fix(f)
All of these are common debugger commands
step(s)
2  
fix is not he correct one.
>Random question
How fast do you have to slap a chicken to cook it?
600MPH
900MPH
10000MPH
5000MPH
4 
Friction = heat.
>Errors
Which of the following mistakes is a syntax error?
Failing to surround values with open and closing quotes
Failing to match every opening parenthesis with a closing parenthesis 
All of these are syntax errors
leaving off the ending colon after an if statement
3 
You know why.
>python orgin
What is python named after?
Monty Python
Good Burger
Dora
This should be real easy
4
The creater of python watched monty python when creating python. 
>Basics
What kind of programming language is python?
Binary
Interpreted
Imaginary
Compiled
2 
Computer language has to be interprteted.
>Installing
Which of the following steps is required in order to run Python on your local computer? 
Pay licensing fee
Install the python interpreter
All of these are true
Register the python software
2 
That's all you got to do is install.
>Differences
Which of the following best describes the difference between a list and a tuple?
Nothing is different
lists can store numbers of elements, while tuples are better at storing larger data sets
list contents can be changed, while tuple contents cannot be changed after tuple is intialized
lists can store any data type, while tuples are restricted to a single data type
3
You can change lists because they're list, while tuples are set in stone.
>Breakpoints
Which of the following best describes a breakpoint?
A line of code that will cause a program error.
A temporary output statement that will print messages containing useful debugging information
A decision point in your code that will decide which statements to execute
A line of code that will put your program into break state
4
Break-points are useful because you can find errors fast.
>Breakpoints
What do we call the program state that allows you to examine the contents of your variables and step through code line-by-line?
Break state
Diagnostic state
Running state
Safety state
1
Because you're able to see each code error you make.
>Random question
What is Patricks pet rock name?
Cheese-nibles
Rocky
Creed
Gary
2
Spondge bob is life.
>Functions
How many parameter are provided to the str.format() funtion?
None 
3 only
1 or more as needed to build your output string
1 only
3
you will need at least 1 to start then add more to build output.
>Library  
Which of the following statements will let you use the Python date and time library? 
Import datetime
User date time

:
%
!
-
2 
% is the correct formating for datetime
>Floating points
Which of the following statements will produce a random floating point value between -10.0 and +15.0?
rand = random.random(-10.0, 15.0)
rand = random.uniform(-10.0, 15.0)
rand = random.random() * 10 - 15
rand = random.randrange(-10, 15)
2
OK
>Generating
Which of the following statements will generate a random integer from 1 up to (but not including) 100?
rand = random.randrange(0,99)
rand = random(0,99)
rand = random(0,100)
rand = random.randrange(0,100)
4
Random will randomize and remeber(0,100)/Subtract 1 from 100 cause it wont include 100.
>END
